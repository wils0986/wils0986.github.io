            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Jenny, I am 27 years old and I am origianlly from Toronto, <abbr title="Ontario">ON</abbr>. I recently came to the conclusion that my career as a Hairstylist was coming to an end. I have been in the industry for about eight years which had definite <sup>highs</sup> and <sub>lows</sub>. I felt that such a physically demanding career may not be a great choice as I get older, as well as working nights, weekends, not having the security of a salary, and finally being out of work for <em>many</em> months due to <abbr title="SARS-CoV-2">Covid-19</abbr> lockdowns was not sustainable. So, I started to consider a career that is more relevant to my interests, as well as one that could carry on virtually if need be. I have always had a passion for <abbr title="Personal Computers">PCs</abbr>, both for gaming as well as learning as much as possible about how to interact with software and hardware. My father practiced coding for his entire career, which for him started back in the 60's and consisted of programming things like <abbr title="Automated Teller Machines">ATMs</abbr> and flight simulators. He went on to spend the majority of his adult career working for <abbr title="Royal Bank of Canada">RBC</abbr>.  As a result, I had my own <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> (with internet) in my bedroom by age two, which I believe strongly contributed to my interest in computers and the world of technology.</p>

                <p> For my 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph, I thought I would talk about music. I have loved rock, punk, metal, and most genres considered <q>alternative</q> since I can remember. One of my all time favorite bands who you may know, you seem pretty cool, is The Used. I saw them in concert a few years back which was a dream come true! I also really enjoy classic rock, like <abbr title="The Tragically Hip">the Hip</abbr>, who would have been incredible to see live. I have been <em>dying</em> to see a concert for what feels like eternity.</p><hr>
